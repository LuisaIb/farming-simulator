# Farming Simulator

The 'Landwirtschaftssimulator' is a 2D agricultural simulator in which the player may construct his/her own tiny farm.

The action takes place on the vibrant, vivacious FarmingHole Island. The user can grow crops on fields and harvest them when a specific amount of time has passed. Grain kept in a silo or trailer can later be sold at a shop. Of course, the tank of the vehicle in question must be considered. If the tank is empty, the player can pick up a "canister" straight at the gas station and use it to replenish his car. The game is ended when there is no more money available.
